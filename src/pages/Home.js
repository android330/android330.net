const projectInformation =["Over the past 20 years, large data centers in Northern Virginia have significantly increased power demands, requiring utilities like Dominion Energy to build expensive high voltage power lines using large amounts of copper.  A model was built with five nodes, each consisting of a Raspberry Pi and power supply circuit, representing global data centers. Each nodeâ€™s power needs are met by a solar panel, converter, and capacitor. Software-wise, a state machine manages communication, job execution, and progress monitoring through a terminal program.",
  "My contribution to the project involved coding the state machine used by the program.  The nodes connect via TCP, and a job class interface allows for easy management of tasks, such as running the Monte Carlo algorithm for calculating pi. The software is written in C++ and compiled with g++ on Raspberry Pi OS, using the WiringPI library.  Code is open source.",
  "Over the last 2 years I have been contributing to the multiple HIL (Hardware In Loop) automotive test benches at Stellantis.  I am in charge of solving issues and validating wiring for the Next generation Dodge muscle car and the Ram 2500 HIL test benches; but I have solved issues for all of the benches that my team has handled.  I am generally the go to for HIL bench issues my coworkers are unsure of how to solve, as over the two years that I have been working at Stellantis I have developed a very thorough understanding of my craft.",
  "Contributing to these HIL test benches has taught me a variety of different skills.  The most prominent of these is the problem solving and intuition that I developed in regards to an industry that I had no prior experience in.  Solving an issue for the test bench often required me to reference multiple documents to develop a thorough understanding as to how the feature in question worked, and often posed a challenge that I found enjoyable to solve; akin to a good puzzle.  I also developed thorough communication skills, as I often had to coordiante with multiple parties on multiple teams to remedy a solution."
